"Issue Name","Issue Type","Issue Priority","URLs","% of Total","Description","How To Fix","Help URL"
"H2: Multiple","Warning","Low","27","24.320","Pages which have multiple <h2>s. This is not an issue as HTML standards allow multiple <h2>'s when used in a logical hierarchical heading structure. However, this filter can help you quickly scan to review if they are used appropriately.","Ensure <h2>s are used in a logical hierarchical heading structure, and update where appropriate utilising the full heading rank between (h3 - h6) for additional headings.",""
"Images: Over 100 KB","Opportunity","Medium","1","10.000","Large images over a size threshold. Page speed is extremely important for users and SEO and often large resources such as images are one of the most common issues that slow down web pages. This filter simply acts as a general rule of thumb to help identify images that are fairly large in file size and may take longer to load. These should be considered for optimisation, alongside opportunities identified in the PageSpeed tab which uses the PSI API and Lighthouse to audit speed. This can help identify images that haven't been optimised in size, load offscreen, are unoptimised etc.","Uncompressed images bloat pages with unnecessary bytes, so ensure images are optimised with compression, properly scaled, and using the best image format to reduce file size where possible.",""
"Security: Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header","Warning","Low","216","95.580","URLs that are missing the 'X-Content-Type-Options' response header with a 'nosniff' value. In the absence of a MIME type, browsers may 'sniff' to guess the content type to interpret it correctly for users. However, this can be exploited by attackers who can try and load malicious code, such as JavaScript via an image they have compromised.","To minimise security issues, the X-Content-Type-Options response header should be supplied and set to 'nosniff'. This instructs browsers to rely only on the Content-Type header and block anything that does not match accurately. This also means the content-type set needs to be accurate.",""
"H2: Non-Sequential","Warning","Low","35","31.530","Pages with an <h2> that is not the second heading level after the <h1> on the page. Heading elements should be in a logical sequentially-descending order. The purpose of heading elements is to convey the structure of the page and they should be in logical order from <h1> to <h6>, which helps navigating the page and users that rely on assistive technologies.","Ensure the <h2> is the second heading on the page. Headings should be in a logical sequential order from <h1> to <h6>. Review and update page heading levels so they are descending in order, for example the heading element following an <h1> should be an <h2>, rather than an <h3>.",""
"Canonicals: Missing","Warning","Medium","100","90.090","Pages that have no canonical URL present either as a link element, or via HTTP header. If a page doesn't indicate a canonical URL, Google will identify what they think is the best version or URL. This can lead to ranking unpredictability when there are multiple versions discovered, and hence generally all URLs should specify a canonical version","Specify a canonical URL for every page to avoid any potential ranking unpredictability if multiple versions of the same page are discovered on different URLs.",""
"Content: Low Content Pages","Opportunity","Medium","47","42.340","Pages with a word count that is below the default 200 words. The word count is based upon the content area settings used in the analysis which can be configured via 'Config > Content > Area'. There isn't a minimum word count for pages in reality, but the search engines do require descriptive text to understand the purpose of a page. This filter should only be used as a rough guide to help identify pages that might be improved by adding more descriptive content in the context of the website and page's purpose. Some websites, such as ecommerce, will naturally have lower word counts, which can be acceptable if a products details can be communicated efficiently.","Consider including additional descriptive content to help the user and search engines better understand the page.",""
"Images: Missing Size Attributes","Opportunity","Low","10","100.000","Image elements without dimensions (width and height size attributes) specified in the HTML. This can cause large layout shifts as the page loads and be frustrating experience for users. It is one of the major reasons that contributes to a high Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).","Define all image sizes as their native size using width and height attributes in the HTML. This allows the browser to calculate enough space for each image before it loads, avoiding large layout shifts.",""
"Security: Unsafe Cross-Origin Links","Warning","Low","5","2.210","URLs that link to external websites using the target=""_blank"" attribute (to open in a new tab), without using rel=""noopener"" (or rel=""noreferrer"") at the same time. Using target=""_blank"" alone leaves those pages exposed to both security and performance issues for some legacy browsers, which are estimated to be below 5% of market share. Setting target=""_blank"" on <a> elements implicitly provides the same rel behavior as setting rel=""noopener"" which does not set window.opener for most modern browsers, such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge.  The external links that contain the target=""_blank"" attribute by itself can be viewed in the 'outlinks' tab and 'target' column. They can be exported alongside the pages they are linked from via 'Bulk Export > Security > Unsafe Cross-Origin Links'.","Consider the benefits of including the rel=""noopener"" link attribute on any links that contain the target=""_blank"" attribute to avoid security and performance issues for the users of legacy browsers that may visit the website.",""
"Canonicals: Canonicalised","Warning","High","11","9.910","Pages that have a canonical to a different URL. The URL is 'canonicalised' to another location. This means the search engines are being instructed to not index the page, and the indexing and linking properties should be consolidated to the URL in the canonical.","These URLs should be reviewed carefully to ensure the indexing and link signals are being consolidated to the correct URL. In a perfect world, a website wouldn't need to canonicalise any URLs as only canonical versions would be linked to internally on a website, but often they are required due to various circumstances outside of control, and to prevent duplicate content. Update internal links to canonical versions of URLs where possible.",""
"Content: Readability Difficult","Opportunity","Low","3","2.700","Copy on the page is difficult to read and best understood by college graduates according to the Flesch reading-ease score formula. Copy that has long sentences and uses complex words are generally harder to read and understand.","Consider improving the readability of copy for your target audience. Copy that uses shorter sentences with less complex words is often easier to read and understand.",""
"Canonicals: Non-Indexable Canonical","Issue","High","11","9.910","Pages with a canonical URL that is non-indexable. This will include canonicals which are blocked by robots.txt, no response, redirect (3XX), client error (4XX), server error (5XX), are 'noindex' or 'canonicalised' themselves. This means the search engines are being instructed to consolidate indexing and link signals to a non-indexable page, which often leads to them ignoring the canonical, but may also lead to unpredictability in indexing and ranking. Export pages, their canonicals and status codes via 'Reports > Canonicals > Non-Indexable Canonicals'.","Ensure canonical URLs are to accurate indexable pages to avoid them being ignored by search engines, and any potential indexing or ranking unpredictability.",""
"H2: Missing","Warning","Low","11","9.910","Pages which have a missing <h2>, the content is empty or has a whitespace. The <h2> heading is often used to describe sections or topics within a document. They act as signposts for the user, and can help search engines understand the page.","Consider using logical and descriptive <h2>s on important pages that help the user and search engines better understand the page.",""
"Security: Missing Secure Referrer-Policy Header","Warning","Low","216","95.580","URLs missing 'no-referrer-when-downgrade', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin', 'no-referrer' or 'strict-origin' policies in the Referrer-Policy header. When using HTTPS, it's important that the URLs do not leak in non-HTTPS requests. This can expose users to 'man in the middle' attacks, as anyone on the network can view them.","Consider setting a referrer policy of strict-origin-when-cross-origin. It retains much of the referrer's usefulness, while mitigating the risk of leaking data cross-origins.",""
"Response Codes: Internal Redirection (3xx)","Warning","Low","10","3.890","Internal URLs which redirect to another URL. These will include server-side redirects, such as 301 or 302 redirects (and more). View URLs that link to redirects using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > Internal > Redirection (3xx) inlinks'.","Ideally all internal links would be to canonical resolving URLs, and avoid linking to URLs that redirect. This reduces latency of redirect hops for users, and enhanced efficiency for search engines.",""
"Meta Description: Over 985 Pixels","Opportunity","Low","48","43.240","Pages which have meta descriptions over Google's estimated pixel length limit for snippets. Google snippet length is actually based upon pixels limits, rather than a character length. The SEO Spider tries to match the latest pixel truncation points in the SERPs, but it is an approximation and Google adjusts them frequently.","Write concise meta descriptions to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, and not visible to users.",""
"H1: Over 70 Characters","Opportunity","Low","1","0.900","Pages which have <h1>s over the configured length. There is no hard limit for characters in an <h1>, however they should be clear and concise for users and long headings might be less helpful","Write concise <h1>s for users, including target keywords where natural for users - without keyword stuffing.",""
"H1: Multiple","Warning","Medium","98","88.290","Pages which have multiple <h1>s. While this is not strictly an issue because HTML5 standards allow multiple <h1>s on a page, there are some problems with this modern approach in terms of usability. It's advised to use heading rank (h1-h6) to convey document structure. The classic HTML4 standard defines there should only be a single <h1> per page, and this is still generally recommended for users and SEO.","Consider updating the HTML to include a single <h1> on each page, and utilising the full heading rank between (h2 - h6) for additional headings.",""
"H1: Duplicate","Opportunity","Low","98","88.290","Pages which have duplicate <h1>s. It's important to have distinct, unique and useful main headings. If every page has the same <h1>, then it can make it more challenging for users and the search engines to understand one page from another.","Update duplicate <h1>s as necessary, so important pages contain a unique and descriptive <h1> for users and search engines.  If these are duplicate pages, then fix the duplicated pages by linking to a single version, and redirect or use canonicals where appropriate.",""
"Page Titles: Over 561 Pixels","Opportunity","Medium","55","49.550","Pages which have page titles over Google's estimated pixel length limit for titles in search results. Google snippet length is actually based upon pixels limits, rather than a character length. The SEO Spider tries to match the latest pixel truncation points in the SERPs, but it is an approximation and Google adjusts them frequently.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring.",""
"Validation: Multiple <body> Tags","Issue","High","1","0.440","Pages with multiple <body> elements in the HTML. There should only be one <body> element in the HTML which contains all content for the document. Browsers and Googlebot will try to combine content from subsequent <body> elements, however this should not be relied upon and is open to potential mix ups.","Ensure all pages have a single valid <body> element with appropriate content for the document.",""
"Links: Internal Outlinks With No Anchor Text","Opportunity","Low","1","0.900","Pages that have internal links without anchor text or images that are hyperlinked without alt text. Anchor text is the visible text and words used in hyperlinks that provide users and search engines context about the content of the target page. Internal outlinks without anchor text can be seen in the 'Outlinks' tab, with the 'All Link Types' filter set to 'Hyperlinks', where the 'Anchor Text' column is blank, or if an image, the 'Alt Text' column is also blank. Export in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Links > Internal Outlinks With No Anchor Text'.","Review the missing anchor text outlinks and where appropriate include useful and descriptive anchor text to help users and search engines.",""
"Meta Description: Over 155 Characters","Opportunity","Low","52","46.850","Pages which have meta descriptions over the configured limit. Characters over this limit might be truncated in Google's search results.","Write concise meta descriptions to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, and not visible to users.",""
"Security: Missing Content-Security-Policy Header","Warning","Low","216","95.580","URLs that are missing the Content-Security-Policy response header. This header allows a website to control which resources are loaded for a page. This policy can help guard against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that exploit the browser's trust of the content received from the server. The SEO Spider only checks for existence of the header, and does not interrogate the policies found within the header to determine whether they are well set-up for the website. This should be performed manually.","Set a strict Content-Security-Policy response header across all page to help mitigate cross site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.",""
"Page Titles: Over 60 Characters","Opportunity","Medium","51","45.950","Pages which have page titles that exceed the configured limit. Characters over this limit might be truncated in Google's search results and carry less weight in scoring.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring.",""
"Content: Lorem Ipsum Placeholder","Warning","High","1","0.900","Pages that contain 'Lorem ipsum' text that is commonly used as a placeholder to demonstrate the visual form of a webpage. This can be left on web pages by mistake, particularly during new website builds.","Review pages that contain 'Lorem ipsum' text and ensure any placeholder text is replaced with unique, original and relevant copy for the web page.",""
"H2: Duplicate","Opportunity","Low","10","9.010","Pages which have duplicate <h2>s. It's important to have distinct, unique and useful pages. If every page has the same <h2>, then it can make it more challenging for users and the search engines to understand one page from another.","Update duplicate <h2>s as necessary, so important pages contain a unique and descriptive <h2> for users and search engines.

"Validation: Multiple <head> Tags","Issue","High","1","0.440","Pages with multiple <head> elements in the HTML. There should only be one <head> element in the HTML which contains all critical metadata for the document. Browsers and Googlebot will combine metadata from subsequent <head> elements if they are both before the <body>, however this should not be relied upon and is open to potential mix-ups. Any <head> tags after the <body> starts will be ignored.","Ensure all pages have a single valid <head> element with appropriate metadata for the document that is the first element in the <html> element.",""
"Response Codes: External Client Error (4xx)","Warning","Low","2","0.780","External URLs with a client-side error. This indicates a problem occurred with the URL request and can include responses such as 400 bad request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Page Not Found, 410 Removed, 429 Too Many Requests and more. A 404 'Page Not Found' is the most common, and often referred to as a broken link. View URLs that link to errors using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > External > Client Error (4xx) inlinks'.","All links on a website should ideally resolve to 200 'OK' URLs. Errors such as 404 broken links should be updated so users are taken to the correct URL, or removed. A 403 forbidden error occurs when a web server denies access to the SEO Spider's request and can often be resolved by switching the user-agent to Chrome via 'Config > User-Agent'. If they can be viewed in a browser, then it's often not an issue.",""
"Response Codes: External No Response","Warning","Low","5","1.950","External URLs with no response returned from the server. Usually due to a malformed URL, connection timeout, connection error, or connection refused. View URLs that link to no responses using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > External > No Response inlinks'.","Malformed URLs should be updated to the correct location and other connection issues can often be resolved by using different user-agents ('Config > User-Agent'), adjusting the crawl speed ('Config > Speed') or disabling firewalls & proxies.

"Security: Missing X-Frame-Options Header","Warning","Low","216","95.580","URLs missing an X-Frame-Options response header with a 'DENY' or 'SAMEORIGIN' value. This instructs the browser not to render a page within a frame, iframe, embed or object.
